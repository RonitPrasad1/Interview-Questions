# Interview-Questions
Different Interview Questions from my interview experience.

Optiver Internship: Did not get the candidacy. 
  - The questions were fairly doable, except for that Error Checking BST problem. 


Expedia Internship:
  - I realized my mistakes and noticed what I did incorrectly. More specifically, I got the simple ascending question and that 
    pseudocode question incorrect. Unfortunately, due to that time crunch, I didn't get to complete the questions perfectly, 
    but it was an amazing experience!
